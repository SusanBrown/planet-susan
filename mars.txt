Mars is named for the god of war, although the planet itself has little to do with the attributes associated with the god of war. But the Greeks didn't know that.
Really nomenclature of this sort is quite ludicrous, but so heavily layered with cultural detritus that we continue to make the associations.
Truly tedious all of this piling up of nonsense about Mars.
